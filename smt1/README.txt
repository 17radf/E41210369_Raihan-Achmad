⚠️ confusing messy code ⚠️

Final Project -> Semester 1

> hell of a messy code, in need of heavy refactoring (cause of rushing for 3 days to finish it all)
> everything is a mess to begin with actually, the database is cool enough ig
> open it with netbeans 8, netbeans 12 has an issue with jasper connection (weird)
> ask me anything

nb: tbh, why they need an app for "toko buah" when they wont bother to afford or use laptop or printer at all
and... this semester 1 repo is the ultimate reason why you shouldn't rush over your code.
